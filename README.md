# django-simple game

A singleplayer game using the Django framework.

What do I need first?

Nothing much, just Python 3+ and (ideally) virtualenv.

How do I start it?

Clone the repo, cd to the repo directory then run (again, ideally inside a virtualenv):

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ python manage.py migrate

$ python manage.py runserver

How do I play?

Assuming you're using the default templates and not rolling your own, go to localhost:8000/first . Have signup and login using the links from the homepage.
